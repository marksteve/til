## Replaced elements can't have `:before` or `:after` pseudo classes

Example of [replaced elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element)
are `img`, `object`, `video` and `input`. Their [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/generate.html#before-after-content)
doesn't fully define the interaction of `:before` and `:after`.
