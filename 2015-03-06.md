## Trim images using ImageMagick

```bash
convert image.png -trim trimmed-image.png
```

## Archive repos using `git subtree`

We had old repos in our PythonPH GitHub organization that I wanted to archive.
I wanted to put everything in one repo while retaining their histories.
How do we do this? Using `git subtree`!

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=repo https://github.com/pythonph/repo master
```

This command pulls from the remote repo `pythonph/repo` and adds its tree
to the current repo under the prefix `repo`. 

Here's the actual archive repo: https://github.com/pythonph/archive
